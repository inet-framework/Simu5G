# The expected value of a check is computed here, from the scenario's own
# parameters, and never read from a previous run of the model. That is the
# whole point of this directory: a fingerprint tells you the trajectory
# changed, this tells you whether the physics is still right, and it keeps
# saying so after a fingerprint has been re-recorded.

# Result files are read through omnetpp.scave.results, the same library the
# IDE and opp_scavetool use, rather than by parsing .sca text here. It needs
# omnetpp/python on PYTHONPATH, which sourcing the OMNeT++ setenv script does.

# Tolerance policy, stated once for every statistical check in this directory

#
# A check whose observed value is a fraction of N independent Bernoulli trials
# is graded against a K-sigma band around the closed-form probability, where
# sigma is the binomial standard error sqrt(q(1-q)/N). K = 4 puts the
# false-failure rate of a correct model at about 1 in 16000 per check, which
# is small enough that the suite does not cry wolf, while still catching every
# structural error seen so far -- those move the result by a factor, not by a
# few percent.
#
# The band is only as tight as N allows: at q = 0.0081 and N = 10000 it is
# +-43% of q, at q = 0.0625 it is +-15%. A case's own sigma figure is printed
# with its verdict so the reader can see how discriminating it actually was.
