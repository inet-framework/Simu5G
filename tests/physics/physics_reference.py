# A check whose observed value is a fraction of N independent Bernoulli trials

# sigma is the binomial standard error sqrt(q(1-q)/N). K = 4 puts the
# false-failure rate of a correct model at about 1 in 16000 per check, which
# is small enough that the suite does not cry wolf, while still catching every
# structural error seen so far -- those move the result by a factor, not by a
# few percent.
