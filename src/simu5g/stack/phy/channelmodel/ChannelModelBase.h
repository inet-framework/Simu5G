/**
 * A radio link between two arbitrary endpoints, and the parameters the channel
 * model needs to evaluate it.
 *
 * The channel model used to be phrased as "a link between me (phy_->getCoord())
 * and one remote endpoint", with Direction selecting -- all at once -- which
 * endpoint was mobile, which antenna gains applied, and which noise figure
 * applied. A UE-to-UE link fits neither of those two shapes, which is why the
 * D2D channel model had to re-implement the whole propagation path rather than
 * reuse it.
 *
 * Here those things are data. `dir` survives only as a tag: it selects the
 * statistic to emit and dispatches the (genuinely cellular-topology-aware)
 * interference computation, but it no longer derives any of the link geometry
 * or the link budget.

/**
 * Abstract base for the channel models a PHY layer can be equipped with.
 *
 * This is not a propagation model: it is the interface to the entire PHY link
 * model. A channel model is asked for received power (getRSRP), for per-band
 * SINR (getSINR, getSINR_bgUe), and for the reception decision itself
 * (isReceptionSuccessful), so it owns propagation, fading, interference and
 * the SINR-to-error mapping alike. Path loss (getAttenuation,
 * computePathLoss) is one ingredient among those, not the subject of the
 * class.
 *
 * The class and interface names are RAT-neutral: the concrete models differ
 * in which 3GPP propagation study supplies their formulas (the pathLossType
 * parameter), not in whether they serve an LTE or an NR carrier, and any of
 * them can be plugged into the channelModelType slot of any NIC through the
 * IChannelModel interface -- the gNodeB NIC, for instance, selects the
 * Tr38901ChannelModel preset there by default. Everything
 * technology-dependent -- carrier frequency, bandwidth, numerology -- is
 * read from the ComponentCarrier module rather than encoded in the class.
