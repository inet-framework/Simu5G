/**

 *
 * LOS/NLOS, shadowing and multipath fading are properties of a *link*, not of a
 * node: two links from the same transmitter to peers in different directions and
 * at different distances have independent realizations. Keying that state by node
 * -- which is what this model did historically -- is harmless for cellular, where
 * a UE has exactly one link per channel-model instance, but wrong for D2D, where
 * one UE has many peers and they all shared a single slot.
 *
 * The pair is stored normalized so that a link is the same key seen from either
 * end. Cellular callers construct the degenerate key {id, id}, which reproduces
 * the historical node-keyed behavior exactly.

 * endpoint was mobile, which antenna gains applied, which noise figure applied,
 * and which fading/shadowing map to use. A UE-to-UE link fits neither of those
 * two shapes, which is why the D2D channel model had to re-implement the whole
 * propagation path rather than reuse it.

 * Here those four things are data. `dir` survives only as a tag: it selects the
 * statistic to emit and dispatches the (genuinely cellular-topology-aware)
 * interference computation, but it no longer derives any of the link geometry

/**
 * Abstract base for the channel models a PHY layer can be equipped with.
 *
 * This is not a propagation model: it is the interface to the entire PHY link
 * model. A channel model is asked for received power (getRSRP), for per-band
 * SINR (getSINR, getSIR, getSINR_bgUe), and for the reception decision itself
 * (isReceptionSuccessful), so it owns propagation, fading, interference and
 * the SINR-to-error mapping alike. Path loss (getAttenuation,
 * computePathLoss) is one ingredient among those, not the subject of the
 * class.
 *
 * The class and interface names are RAT-neutral: the concrete models differ
 * in which 3GPP propagation study supplies their formulas (the pathLossType
 * parameter), not in whether they serve an LTE or an NR carrier, and any of
 * them can be plugged into the channelModelType slot of any NIC through the
 * IChannelModel interface -- the gNodeB NIC, for instance, selects the
 * Tr38901ChannelModel preset there by default. Everything
 * technology-dependent -- carrier frequency, bandwidth, numerology -- is
 * read from the ComponentCarrier module rather than encoded in the class.
