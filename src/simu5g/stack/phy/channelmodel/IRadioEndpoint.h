/**
 * What a channel model needs to know about a node's radio, and nothing more.
 *
 * A channel model evaluates links between radio endpoints -- its own node's and
 * other nodes'. From each endpoint it needs five things: where it is, how its
 * antenna radiates (omnidirectionally or sectorially, and in which direction),
 * how much power it transmits, and which channel model it uses on a given
 * carrier. PhyBase implements this interface, and the channel model reaches
 * PHYs -- its own and its peers' -- only through it. That is what lets a channel
 * model be exercised against stub endpoints without instantiating a node.
 *
 * The default arguments repeat PhyBase's. Default arguments of a virtual
 * function are bound by the static type of the call, so a call through this
 * interface and one through PhyBase agree only while the two stay identical.
