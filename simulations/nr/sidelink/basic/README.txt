NR sidelink (PC5) — basic out-of-coverage example
=================================================

Two cell-less NrUe nodes (no gNodeB anywhere, servingNodeId = 0), 20 m apart.
ue[0] runs an AlertSender towards the multicast group 224.0.0.10; ue[1] runs
an AlertReceiver and is a member of the group (see demo.xml).

Configs:

- OutOfCoverage: sidelink disabled (WP-A spike). Verifies that cell-less UEs
  initialize cleanly and that all application packets are dropped at the
  serving-node checks (HandoverPacketHolderUe / TechnologyDecision).

- Broadcast (milestone M1, WP-C): hasSidelink = true. Alert messages are
  delivered app-to-app over the PC5 leg:
  ip2nic (SL classification) -> PDCP -> RLC UM -> slMac -> slPhy
  -> peer slPhy -> slRlcMux -> PDCP -> ip2nic -> app.
  WP-C simplifications: one static preconfigured periodic grant per UE
  (staticGrantSlotOffset), ideal PHY decoding (no channel model /
  interference yet), no HARQ, no sensing. See the sidelink implementation
  plan for the WP-D..WP-G roadmap (TR 37.885 channel, mode-2 sensing-based
  resource selection, blind HARQ, PRR/PIR statistics).
